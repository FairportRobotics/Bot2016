Things we need to test
- climbing winch
- ball intake and output
- autonomous mode movements (all of them)
-- distance
-- turning radius
-- break down into motions and test individually (which implies testing each defense)
-- UI works as expected
-- pitch stuff is working
- teleop driving
- testing the arm
- fully integrated autonomous mode (start to end)
- camera functionality (which way should the camera face)
- validate the addresses of every talon (RobotMap)
- establish any calibration routines
- clean UI (get competition involved)
- ?
- profit
